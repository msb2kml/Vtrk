# Vtrk Documentation

[General information](../README.md)


### Usage

Some kinds of tasks could be performed.

![Tasks](Gallery/Tasks.jpg)

The main task is probably to display a file: this is explained
here: [Display](Display.md).  
A file has to be selected: [File](File.md).  
The color of a track could be used to give some indication:
[Colors](Colors.md).  
A chart of some data like an elevation profile could be
produced: [Chart](Chart.md).

The other tasks are described here: [Actions](Actions.md). They
are also available from inside the Display task.  
This include the merging of file: [Composition](Composition.md).  
And also the creation of new elements on the map: [Picking](Picking.md).

Instead of being launched alone, Vtrk could be invoked by another
application. This is explained here: [Intent](Intent.md).
